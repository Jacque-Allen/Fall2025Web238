            <p><b>ZOOM:</b><p>
              <p>
              When you complete your registration you’ll be asked for an email address. A link and password for our Zoom session will be sent via email. 
               If you’re not proficient with Zoom, please practice using beforehand. I also suggest testing your equipment a few minutes before the session 
               so you don’t lose valuable time to technical issues.*
              </p>
              <p> At the scheduled date/time we’ll connect via Zoom and briefly discuss what issues you (or your pet) may want to address. Afterwards, you 
                can mute your video/audio. You and your pet need only be open to receive the flow of Reiki energy. I suggest finding a comfortable place to
                 relax and playing some soft music (or even take a nap!) Once the session is over, we can discuss your experience and any questions you may have.</p>
                 <p><b>*</b>If for some reason you are having network issues please contact me via telephone and we can conduct the session another way.</p>
            
            <p><b>TELEPHONE</b></p>
            <p>At the scheduled date and time, I’ll contact you at the telephone number you provide when you schedule the appointment. We can discuss 
              any concerns or issues you may have and you can then hang up. You and your pet need only be open to receive the flow of Reiki energy. 
               I suggest finding a comfortable place to relax and playing some soft music (or even take a nap!)</p>
               <p>Once the session is over, I will call you so we can discuss your experience and any questions you may have. </p>

            <p><b>EMAIL</b></p>
            <p>If you (or your pet) prefer to receive distance Reiki via email, I’ll email you at the address you provided on your intake forms. 
               Just before your appointed time, I’ll communicate with you via email as a reminder. </p>
            <p>If you wish to relax and receive the Reiki with your pet at the appointed time, you may want to find a comfortable place and play
               some soft music. However, distance Reiki will work regardless. All you and your pet need do is be open to receive Reiki.</p>
            <p>After the session is complete, I’ll email you with feedback and you can address any questions you may have.</p>

            <p><b>Optional: Animal + Human Duo Session — Reiki sent to both you and your animal companion in one healing session.</b></p>
